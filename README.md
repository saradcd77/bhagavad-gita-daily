**Making the timeless wisdom of Bhagavad Gita relevant to modern life.**

## ✨ Why Gita Today?

The Bhagavad Gita was spoken over 5,000 years ago, yet its teachings remain profoundly relevant. We believe that:

- **Ancient wisdom shouldn't feel distant** — it should feel like advice from a wise friend
- **Everyone faces struggles** — and Krishna's guidance can help navigate them
- **Spiritual growth can be simple** — one verse, one reflection, one day at a time

This app is designed to be a **digital temple for daily clarity** — sacred but clean, profound but accessible.
